    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <img src="../images/pizza.jpg" alt="Pepperoni Pizza">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>It's pizza, the delightful dish from Italy (probably). Bread, tomato sauce, cheese, and an enormous variety of toppings are available. We will provide a recipe for Pepperoni Pizza, but use any toppings you like (yes, even pineapple).</p>
    
    <h3>Equipment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Oven capable of 425 degrees F</li>
      <li>Two 12-inch pizza pans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>6 oz of Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Pizza Crust</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 oz yeast (Pizza Crust Yeast)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups very warm water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Toppings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>6 oz sliced pepperoni</li>
      <li>1+ cup(s) shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>For sauce: combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze any leftover tomato paste.</li>
      <li>For crusts: combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar, and salt. Add the water and oil then mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
      <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. Using certain kinds of yeast, let dough rest while covered for 10 minutes or as directed by the product package.</li>
      <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
      <li>For pizzas: preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni, and cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom over racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
